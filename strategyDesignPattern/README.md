# Strategy Design Pattern
- The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a class to change its behavior at runtime by 
selecting from a family of algorithms. It lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them 
interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime based on the context or the situation.
- When multiple child classes using a method with same implementation that is not present in parent class then we can use 
strategy design pattern.

## Benefits
Flexibility: You can easily add new algorithms without modifying existing code (open/closed principle).
