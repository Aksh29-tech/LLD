# SOLID Principles 
**S - Single Responsibility Principle** <br>
**O - Open/Closed Principle** <br>
**L - Liskov Substitution Principle** <br>
**I - Interface segmented Principle** <br>
**D - Dependency Inversion Principle** <br>

## Advantages
- Avoid Duplicate Code
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible Software 
- Reduce Complexity

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- If class B is a subclass of class A, then we should be able to replace object A with B without breaking the behavior 
of the program.
- Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interface should be such that client should not implement unnecessary function they do not need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete class.
